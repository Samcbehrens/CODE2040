Strangely enough, I did not struggle to much on the actual coding problems. 
I really did struggle with the JSON libraries, REST, and Java. I have never 
really coded to connect to a client especially using Java and since I was 
not familiar with the libraries I had to scour through the internet to find 
a good way to turn in the problems. I also struggled with turning in the array
of Strings because of how I had to encode the array to be a valid JSON using 
the HTTP java methods. I was worried that I would not be able to turn in the 
completed problems that I had done but was very proud when I figured out how
to turn them in.
